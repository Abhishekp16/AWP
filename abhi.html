    <h4>-By Abhishek Pawar</h4>
<pre> Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything.
    Music, once admitted to the soul, becomes a sort of spirit, and never dies.
    No matter how corrupt, greedy, and heartless our government, our corporations, our media, and our religious & charitable institutions may become, the music will still be wonderful.
    You have to, take a deep breath. and allow the music to flow through you. Revel in it, allow yourself to awe. When you play allow the music to break your heart with its beauty.
    There is music in the air, music all around us; the world is full of it, and you simply take as much as you require.
